============================

tool to recover files from windows file history drive

WARNING: this is some piece of hacked-together-software. Nobody takes any responsibility for any errors or bugs.
never trust the result (but check it yourself)

you will need java to use this tool

usage: java -jar recover.jar x:\backup-drive\ c:\Users\user\Desktop\recovered

I used it to recover in chunks, not bulk as sometimes a file causes a crash (the application is hacked together and not stable)
